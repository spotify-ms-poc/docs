00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Steel has existed for thousands of years,

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
but it wasn't until the 19th century that it became an essential commodity.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The invention of the Bessemer process revolutionized the steel industry,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
spurring the growth of major cities and giving birth to the Industrial Revolution.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
From the construction of towering skyscrapers

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
to the manufacturing of autos and household appliances,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
steel remains a backbone of civilization.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But the emergence of the modern steel industry

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
has also contributed to the beginning of what would become today's climate concerns.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
So the steel industry globally accounts for about 7-9% of CO2 emissions,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and so there really is this big need to decarbonize.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
About 70% of today's steel is produced using the blast furnace method,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
which relies heavily on coal to generate the heat necessary to reduce iron ore,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
resulting in large amounts of carbon emissions.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Every ton of crude steel produced using this technique emits around 2 tons of CO2,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
so green steel promises to change this whole dynamic.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Also known as sustainable steel or fossil-free steel,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
green steel is a revolutionary concept that aims to transform the industry

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
by replacing coal with cleaner energy products in the production process.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Green hydrogen has a substitute to coal in the production process,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so to make it simple, we're really replacing coal by wind and solar.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Substituting carbon-heavy material with water vapor

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
would bring net steel emissions to essentially zero

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and create a ripple effect that could reconfigure the structure of the industry

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and create opportunities for new entrants to be disruptive

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
by making technologies and services more accessible and affordable.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
But major headwinds remain.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
So when we look at the amount of renewable energy that's needed

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
for the steel industry to move towards green steel,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
we do not have enough clean energy today.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The technology required to decarbonize steel exists,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
but significant infrastructure changes are required

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
to support and scale low-cost green electricity.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Construction of green hydrogen production tools,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
iron reduction facilities and electric arc furnaces

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
are just a few of the necessary investments.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
But it isn't going to be cheap.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
You're going to need a huge amount of capital investment,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and in Europe alone, for example,

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000
our analysts think that it could cost around $130 billion.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Numbers that size obviously beg the question,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
who will cover the costs?

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Initiatives are already in place to incentivize the transition

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and subsidize the upfront investment.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
One such measure, the United States Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
aims to drive down the cost of key green steel inputs

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
and make the goal of replacing coal with electricity

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
in the production of steel achievable.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
The IRA is a game changer in terms of reducing the cost

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
of clean energy in the United States.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000
This provides a truly massive boost in terms of the economics

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
and the scaling of clean energy.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
European policymakers are also sharpening plans

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
to support the transition with funding,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
hydrogen infrastructure investment and carbon border taxes.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
But further efforts may be needed to make green steel a reality.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Achieving net zero carbon neutrality

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
and really halting the impact of climate change

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
is dependent on lots of different factors.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
But steel is a major contributor of greenhouse gases

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and steel will continue to be a really important material globally.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
So finding a way to decarbonize this sector is really crucial

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
if we are to achieve net zero goals.
