00:00:01.15 --> 00:00:04.30
Steel has existed for thousands of years.

00:00:04.80 --> 00:00:09.10
But it wasn't until the 19th century that it became an essential commodity.

00:00:09.25 --> 00:00:18.50
The invention of the Bessemer process revolutionized the steel industry, spurring the growth of major cities and giving birth to the industrial revolution.

00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:27.14
From the construction of towering skyscrapers to the manufacturing of autos and household appliances, steel remains a backbone of civilization.

00:00:28.17 --> 00:00:35.27
But the emergence of the modern steel industry has also contributed to the beginning of what would become today's climate concerns.

00:00:36.24 --> 00:00:45.08
So the steel industry globally accounts for about 7 to 9% of CO2 emissions. And so there really is this big need to decarbonize.

00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:59.15
About 70% of today's steel is produced using the blast furnace method, which relies heavily on coal to generate the heat necessary to reduce iron ore resulting in large amounts of carbon emissions.

00:00:59.29 --> 00:01:06.22
Every tonne of crude steel produced using this technique emits around two tonnes of CO2. So Green Steel promises to change this whole dynamic.

00:01:07.16 --> 00:01:21.29
Also known as sustainable steel or fossil free steel. Green Steel is a revolutionary concept that aims to transform the industry by replacing coal with clean energy products in the production process.

00:01:22.17 --> 00:01:31.00
Green hydrogen as a substitute to coal in the production process. So to make it simple, well, really replacing coal by wind and solar.

00:01:31.21 --> 00:01:55.04
Substituting carbon heavy material with water vapor would bring net steel emissions to essentially zero and create a ripple effect that could reconfigure the structure of the industry and create opportunities for new entrants to be disruptive by making technologies and services more accessible and affordable. But major headwinds remain.

00:01:55.26 --> 00:02:03.15
So when we look at the amount of renewable energy that's needed for the steel industry to move towards green steel, we do not have enough clean energy today.

00:02:04.01 --> 00:02:23.12
The technology required to decarbonize still exists, but significant infrastructure changes are required to support and scale low cost green electricity. Construction of green hydrogen production tools. Iron Reduction facilities and electric arc furnaces are just a few of the necessary investments.

00:02:23.22 --> 00:02:35.29
But it isn't going to be cheap. You're going to need a huge amount of capital investment. And in Europe alone, for example, all analysts think that it could cost around $130 billion.

00:02:36.11 --> 00:03:02.08
Numbers that size, obviously beg the question who will cover the costs? Initiatives are already in place to incentivize the transition and subsidize the upfront investment. One such measure, the United States Inflation Reduction Act, or I.R.A., aims to drive down the cost of key green steel inputs and make the goal of replacing coal with electricity in the production of steel achievable.

00:03:02.20 --> 00:03:14.04
The IRA is a game changer in terms of reducing the cost of clean energy in the United States. This provides a truly massive boost in terms of the economics and the scaling of clean energy.

00:03:14.19 --> 00:03:28.19
European policymakers are also sharpening plans to support the transition with funding hydrogen infrastructure investment and carbon border taxes. But further efforts may be needed to make green steel a reality.

00:03:29.08 --> 00:03:51.25
Achieving net zero carbon neutrality and really halting the impact of climate change is dependent on lots of different factors. But steel is a major contributor of greenhouse gases and steel will continue to be a really important materials globally. So finding a way to decarbonize the sector is really crucial if we are to achieve net zero goals.
